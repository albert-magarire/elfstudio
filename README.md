# ELFStudio

This is a project I decided to build inspired by a popular windows program used to statically analyze PE files. Essentially, this serves as a graphical wrapper for a lot of command line utilities that displays information about an ELF binary. Hopefully it will be of some use to anyone analyzing malware for Linux systems. Any suggestions would be appreciated. 

### Current Feature Set
- Detect File Signature, hash, and other basic information.
- Display program strings.
- Display information on exports, imports, and linked libraries.

### Planned Feature Set
- Retrieve VirusTotal information (feature in development)

### Basic Usage
